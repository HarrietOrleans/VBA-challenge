# VBA-challenge
Attached are four screenshots of the results of my script - one screenshot for each quarter. 

I was unable to save the script as either a VBA file or BAS file so I copied my code into a Word document and submitted it. I hope that this will count as I have asked my instructor and TA and they are not sure why Excel will not allow  VBA files to be saved seperately.
